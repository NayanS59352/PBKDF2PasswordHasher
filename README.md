# PBKDF2PasswordHasher

A hashing algorithm that use PBKDF2, and outputs it as String rather than Base64. Some of the code has been left out because the programmer needs to configure it to their code but everything else can be used with whatever you're doing probably. If you want you can also get rid of the encoders and decoders so it takes in base64 values and outputs them in base64.
